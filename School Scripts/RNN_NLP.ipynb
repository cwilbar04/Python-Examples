Management is exploring the use of Recurrent Neural Networks using pretrained word vectors.

    "In this notebook, we explore using gLove.6B and GloVe.Twitter.27B pretrained word vectors, using 50 and 200 dimensional versions, and a limited vocabulary of the top 25000 versus 250000 words by fitting a 25 neuron Recurrent Neural Network. The models have various success predicting whether a reviewer gives a thumbs-up or thumbs-down to a movie based on the first 20 and last 20 words of a review. \n"

    "**Results and Recomendations** \n",
    "\n",
    "RNN's are great tools for natural language processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "My results suggested using less dimensions makes the model more slighlty generalizable (better test accuracy) and had faster processing times, though better tuning might be needed for the higher parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a larger vocabulary size produced better test accuracy for the Glove Twitter vectors though interestingly not for the 6B word vectors. FUrther analysis needed to determine why.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to identify negative customer feelings in a specific customer service setting, it likely would be beneficial to train custom word vectors with specific words that relate to the specific application setting to get better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "By training an RNN with custom word vectors, it would be possible to identify the reviews with the highest probability of negativity and automate fitlering these messages to support personnel that could reply most quickly to the most negative reviews. The model should continue to learn with new reviews, with adjusted ratings, and an adjusted vocabulary to get the best results."
